I will be a PhD Student of [Purdue University, West Lafayette](https://www.purdue.edu) from May 2023, working with Prof. [Dave Tian](https://davejingtian.org). I have a broad interests in computer systems and security. Before that, I was a PhD Student at [École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne(EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) for seven months, where I did a semester project at [PARSA](https://parsa.epfl.ch). I earned my Bachelor dgree and Master degree from  [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/), under mentor of Prof. [Zhe Zhou](https://cs.fudan.edu.cn/0b/f1/c24865a265201/page.htm). Besides, I was a number of Fudan's CTF team [\*\*\*\*\*\*(Sixstars)](https://github.com/sixstars).

+ (Master Thesis) **Shadow Kernel Extension Framework.** 
    + This is a framework that benefits future kernel extension constructions. In this framework, an extension will be split into two parts: the first part serves requests in the kernel space running with SFI protection; the second part is in a process that handles other time-insensitive jobs.
    + This project is directed by Prof. [Zhe Zhou](https://cs.fudan.edu.cn/0b/f1/c24865a265201/page.htm) and completed in cooperation with [Hailong Nan](https://github.com/hailongeric).
