Currently, I am a PhD Student at [École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne(EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). I earned my Bachelor dgree and Master degree from  [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/), under mentor of Prof. [Zhe Zhou](https://cs.fudan.edu.cn/0b/f1/c24865a265201/page.htm). I'm also a member of Fudan's CTF team [\*\*\*\*\*\*(Sixstars)](https://github.com/sixstars).

### Publications

  * Mingtian Tan\*, **Junpeng Wan**\*, Zhe Zhou, Zhou Li. 
  * [[**paper**]](/files/InvisibleProbe.pdf) [[**code**]](https://github.com/stefan1wan/InvisibleProbe) [[**slides**]](/files/InvisibleProbe.key)
+ (Oakland’22) **MeshUp: Stateless Cache Side-channel Attack on CPU Mesh.** 
  * **Junpeng Wan**, Yanxiang Bi, Zhe Zhou, Zhou Li.

  * Zhe Zhou, Yanxiang Bi, **Junpeng Wan**, Yangfan Zhou, Zhou Li. 
+ (Master Thesis) **Shadow Kernel Extension Framework.** 
    + This is a framework that benefits future kernel extension constructions. In this framework, an extension will be split into two parts: the first part serves requests in the kernel space running with SFI protection; the second part is in a process that handles other time-insensitive jobs.
    + This project is directed by Prof. [Zhe Zhou](https://cs.fudan.edu.cn/0b/f1/c24865a265201/page.htm) and completed in cooperation with [Hailong Nan](https://github.com/hailongeric).
