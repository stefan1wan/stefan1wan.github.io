# RSS: You decide what you read

### Introduction
Sometimes I will feel bored and want to read and learn something new, but at this time, I don't know what to read:  bookmarks in my Chrome are so chaotic; news apps send me a lot of things I am not concerned about.  As a result, I end up spending a lot of time on Moments and Weibo.  Recently, I found that [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) could solve this problem, which makes accessing new updates on my interested websites impossible.  In actuality,  I have collected a lot of information sources from the Internet, like blogs,  tutorials, some official websites, and stuff. But in general, they just lay in my collection directories in my Chrome. If I could use RSS to follow their newer contents, I could have something to read. 

### Solution
My solution is quite simple, divided into three steps:
+ register an account of [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/), which is an RSS reader.
+ add an extension in Chrome: *[RSS Reader Extension (by Inoreader)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rss-reader-extension-by-i/kfimphpokifbjgmjflanmfeppcjimgah)* . If a website has a web feed(support RSS), you could subscript that by clicking this extension.
+ read my subscripts on Inoreader website or the Inoreader application on my phone.

In this way, I could subscript anything which attracts me, and then I could read their new contents when I am bored.

By the way, welcome to subscript my blog with RSS!
