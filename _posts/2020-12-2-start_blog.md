# My First Blog
This is my blog to share what I learn and how I think in my study and work, maybe a project finished or a paper read recently. Also, the moments or thoughts which will be awkward to be shared in the *Moments* and *Weibo*. Besides, I believe that writing is a good way to test whether you really understand something. Hope it will be a long journey.
